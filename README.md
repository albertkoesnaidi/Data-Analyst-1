# Data Analyst 1

Welcome to my Data Analyst 1 directory.

I'm uploading this as my data analyst portfolio. The data (normaly in csv format) won't added into this directory because the file is too bit (more than 25 MB).

There are two datasets used for this analysis. First was the moviedata and second was baby names in the US.

I gathered the data for the first dataset from themoviedb.org using API key.
And the second dataset I got from the internet. 

These two Projects were taught by Alexander Hagmann from Udemy. From him I learnt a lot.
Thank you very much!
